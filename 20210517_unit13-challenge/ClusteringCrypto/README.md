# Unit 13 Homework Assignment - Clustering Crypto

For this assignment, I opted to try the project on Clustering Cryto. 

## Clustering Crypto


### Submission
The submission contains 2 jupyter notebook files - "Main_crypto_clustering.ipynb" and "crypto_clustering_sm.ipynb" which was used to deploy the notebook to Amazon SageMaker. Along with the jupyter notebooks a resource directory has been attached containing the data file "crypto_data.csv" which was used as a data source to execute the project 
The following main tasks have been accomplished as part of the submission:

* **[Data Preprocessing](#Data-Preprocessing):** Preparing the data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

* **[Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA](#Reducing-Data-Dimensions-Using-PCA):** Reducing the data dimension using the `PCA` algorithm from `sklearn`.

* **[Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means](#Clustering-Cryptocurrencies-Using-K-Means):** Predicting clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the `KMeans` algorithm from `sklearn`.

* **[Visualizing Results](#Visualizing-Results):** Creating some plots and data tables to present your results.

* **[Optional Challenge](#Optional-Challenge):** Deploying the notebook to Amazon SageMaker (refer "crypto_clustering_sm.ipynb")
