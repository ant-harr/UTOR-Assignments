# Homework - Unit 6: Pythonic Monopoly
The submission is made in the form of two separate jupyter notebook named as follows:
-   Main_rental_analysis.ipynb: This notebook contains the basic codes for computation and visualisation of data provided in 2 CSV files on Toronto's neighbourhood census data and neighbouhoood location coordinates)
-   Main_dashboard.ipynb: This notebook contains the final computations copied over to buid a dashboard using Panel, to create a final output for the user

The repository containing the two .ipynb submission files and an additional .csv file named "Dwelling_types.csv" where the dataframe is saved as CSV file.

In Main_rental_analysis all optional challenges have succesfully been attempted. However, the dashboard output has been giving an error which could not be rectified.
I'd be grateful if you could help me resolve the error!

THANK YOU
